Project Overview The Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) is a console-based Java application designed to manage the core academic operations of an educational institute. It provides administrators with the tools to manage student records, course catalogs, and academic enrollments in a simple and efficient command-line interface.

This project is built using Java SE 21 and demonstrates a wide range of core Java principles, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), modern file I/O with NIO.2, the Stream API, robust exception handling, and fundamental design patterns.

Features Student Management: Add, list, and find student records. Course Management: Create, list, and search/filter courses. Enrollment Management: Enroll students in available courses with duplicate-checking. Data Persistence: Import and export student and course data from/to simple .csv files. Backup Utility: Create timestamped backups of all application data and recursively calculate the total size of the backup directory. Setup and Installation Prerequisites Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21 or higher. Eclipse IDE for Java Developers or a similar IDE. How to Run Clone the repository to your local machine. Open the project in Eclipse IDE. Locate the CliManager.java file in the edu.ccrm.cli package. Right-click on the CliManager.java file and select Run As > Java Application. The application will start running in the Eclipse console. Windows JDK Installation Steps Download the Java JDK installer for Windows from the official Oracle website. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. After installation, configure the JAVA_HOME and Path environment variables to point to your JDK installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21). Verify the installation by opening a Command Prompt and running java -version. Eclipse IDE Project Setup Launch Eclipse IDE and choose a workspace directory. Go to File > New > Java Project. Enter a project name (e.g., CCRM) and select the appropriate JRE version (e.g., JavaSE-21). Click Finish. The project will be created and will appear in the "Package Explorer". Java Core Concepts Evolution of Java (Key Milestones) JDK 1.0 (1996): The initial release of Java by Sun Microsystems. J2SE 5.0 (2004): A major update that added Generics, Enums, Annotations, and the for-each loop. Java SE 8 (2014): A landmark release that introduced Lambda Expressions, the Stream API, and a new Date and Time API. Java SE 17 (2021): A popular Long-Term Support (LTS) release bringing features like Sealed Classes. Java SE 21 (2023): The latest LTS release, introducing major features like Virtual Threads and improvements to Pattern Matching. Java Platforms: ME vs SE vs EE Java ME (Micro Edition): For small, resource-constrained devices like older mobile phones and IoT devices. Java SE (Standard Edition): The core Java platform used for developing desktop, server, and console applications. This project is built using Java SE. Java EE (Enterprise Edition): Built on top of Java SE, it provides APIs for building large-scale, distributed, and web-based applications (now known as Jakarta EE). Java Architecture: JDK vs JRE vs JVM JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The "engine" that provides the runtime environment to execute Java bytecode. It is responsible for converting bytecode into machine code for the specific platform. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The software package that contains the JVM and the necessary core libraries to run a Java application. JDK (Java Development Kit): The full development kit for Java. It contains everything in the JRE, plus development tools like the compiler (javac) and debugger. A developer needs the JDK to write and compile Java code. Technical Requirements Mapping Requirement File / Method Where Demonstrated OOP - Inheritance Student.java and Instructor.java extend Person.java. OOP - Abstraction Person.java is an abstract class with an abstract getProfile() method. OOP - Polymorphism The getProfile() method is overridden in Student and Instructor. OOP - Encapsulation All domain classes (Student, Course, etc.) use private fields. Design Pattern - Singleton DataStore.java uses a static getInstance() method. Design Pattern - Builder Course.java contains a nested CourseBuilder static class. Exception Handling (Custom) DuplicateEnrollmentException.java is thrown and caught. File I/O (NIO.2) FileServiceImpl.java uses Path, Paths, and Files for all operations. Recursion FileUtils.java has the calculateDirectorySize() method. Java Stream API FileServiceImpl.java uses streams to read CSV files and CourseServiceImpl.java uses them to filter courses. Date/Time API FileServiceImpl.java uses LocalDateTime for backup timestamps. Enums with Fields Grade.java and Semester.java have constructors and fields. Lambdas Used in all Stream API calls, e.g., .filter(line -> !line.isBlank()). Usage and Commands Below is a typical workflow for using the application:

Import Data:

Navigate: Main Menu -> 4. File Operations -> 1. Import Students from CSV This will load the sample student data from data/students.csv. Add a Course:

Navigate: Main Menu -> 2. Manage Courses -> 1. Add New Course Follow the prompts to enter the course details. Enroll a Student:

Navigate: Main Menu -> 3. Manage Enrollment Follow the prompts to enter a Student Registration Number and a Course Code. Export and Backup Data:

Navigate: Main Menu -> 4. File Operations -> 3. Export All Data This will save the current state to new CSV files in the data folder. Navigate: Main Menu -> 4. File Operations -> 4. Backup Exported Data This will create a new timestamped backup folder in the backups directory.
